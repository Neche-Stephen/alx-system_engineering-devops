**Postmortem Report: The Great Database Meltdown of August 2024**

**Issue Summary**

**Duration:**  
The outage occurred from August 14, 2024, 10:30 AM UTC to August 14, 2024, 1:45 PM UTC.

**Impact:**  
The application's database was experiencing severe performance degradation. Users were unable to access certain features, such as real-time updates and task management. Approximately 70% of the users were affected, leading to significant frustration and a drop in user engagement.

**Root Cause:**  
The root cause was an unanticipated surge in traffic combined with an inefficient query design that caused the database to become overwhelmed, leading to high latency and timeout errors.

**Timeline**

- **10:30 AM UTC:** Performance monitoring systems flagged high latency in database queries.
- **10:35 AM UTC:** An engineer noticed degraded application performance and started investigating.
- **10:40 AM UTC:** Initial investigation focused on potential server issues; CPU and memory usage appeared normal.
- **10:50 AM UTC:** A customer complaint highlighted specific features that were unresponsive, prompting further investigation into database performance.
- **11:00 AM UTC:** Assumptions shifted towards database query efficiency after logs showed slow query execution times.
- **11:15 AM UTC:** Investigations revealed that a specific complex query was causing table locks and high resource usage.
- **11:30 AM UTC:** The incident was escalated to the database administration team.
- **12:00 PM UTC:** Database administrators identified that an index was missing on a frequently queried table, exacerbating the performance issue.
- **12:30 PM UTC:** The missing index was added and performance was monitored for stability.
- **1:00 PM UTC:** System performance normalized, and the incident was considered resolved.
- **1:45 PM UTC:** A final review confirmed all services were functioning normally.

**Root Cause and Resolution**

**Root Cause:**  
The outage was caused by a combination of a sudden increase in traffic and an inefficiently designed database query. Specifically, a complex query lacked appropriate indexing, leading to full table scans, excessive locking, and high latency.

**Resolution:**  
To resolve the issue, a missing index was added to the frequently queried table. The addition of the index drastically improved query performance and reduced the load on the database. Monitoring systems were adjusted to better detect such issues in the future.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures**

**Improvements/Fixes:**  
1. **Database Indexing:** Regular reviews of query performance and indexing strategy should be conducted to ensure efficiency.
2. **Monitoring:** Enhance monitoring to include specific metrics for database query performance and load.

**Tasks:**
1. **Add Missing Index:** Apply the index to the affected table and verify query performance improvements.
2. **Optimize Queries:** Review and optimize complex queries to avoid similar performance bottlenecks.
3. **Improve Monitoring:** Update monitoring tools to include detailed metrics for database performance, including query execution times and locking issues.
4. **Load Testing:** Conduct load testing to simulate high traffic conditions and identify potential performance issues in advance.
5. **Documentation:** Document the incident and the resolution steps taken to build a knowledge base for future reference.

This postmortem aims to improve our response to future incidents and enhance system reliability by addressing both the immediate cause and long-term prevention strategies.
